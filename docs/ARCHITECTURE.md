# Architecture Overview

PathReview is a multi-service application with five major subsystems. This document describes how they fit together.

## Subsystem Details

### API Layer (`api/`)
FastAPI application serving REST endpoints. Handles authentication (JWT), request validation (Pydantic), rate limiting, and CORS. Routes delegate to service layer in `core/services/`.

### Ingestion Pipeline (`ingestion/`)
Processes user-submitted documents into vector embeddings. Parsers implement `BaseParser` and extract structured text. Chunkers split text for embedding. The pipeline orchestrates: parse → chunk → embed → store.

### Agent System (`agent/`)
A plan-execute orchestrator that coordinates multiple analysis tools. Each tool implements `BaseTool` with `name`, `description`, and `execute()`. The orchestrator builds a plan based on available profile data, executes tools with retry and timeout policies, and synthesizes results.

### RAG System (`rag/`)
Hybrid retrieval (vector similarity + BM25 keyword) fetches relevant context from the user's ingested documents. The generator uses prompt templates to produce structured, evidence-based feedback. The evaluator scores retrieval relevance and generation faithfulness.

**Hybrid scoring.** `HybridRetriever` combines the two searches into a single ranking with a weighted sum of normalized scores:

```
blended_score = vector_weight * vector_score + keyword_weight * keyword_score
```

`vector_weight` and `keyword_weight` are constructor arguments on `HybridRetriever` and default to `0.7` and `0.3`. Each side is normalized independently before blending: `vector_score` is the chunk's raw similarity divided by the highest similarity in the current result set, and `keyword_score` is its BM25 score divided by the highest BM25 score in the current result set. Normalization is therefore per query rather than against a fixed scale, so the same chunk can normalize differently depending on what else the query returned; a maximum of zero yields a score of `0` rather than a division error. A chunk returned by only one of the two searches keeps `0.0` for the side that did not return it instead of being dropped, so it can still rank if its one score is strong enough.

For example — illustrating the formula, not values taken from a retrieval run — a chunk whose raw vector score is `0.8` where the batch maximum is `1.0`, and whose BM25 score is `6` where the batch maximum is `12`, normalizes to `0.8` and `0.5`. At the default weights that blends to `0.7 * 0.8 + 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.71`.

### Safety Layer (`safety/`)
Middleware wrapping the generation pipeline. Components run in sequence: prompt injection defense → content filter → bias detector → PII scrubber. All safety events are logged with structured metadata for monitoring.

## Key Design Decisions

See the Architecture Decision Records in `docs/adr/` for context on major decisions:
- [ADR-001: Chunking Strategy](adr/001-chunking-strategy.md)
- [ADR-002: Embedding Model Selection](adr/002-embedding-model.md)
- [ADR-003: Agent Orchestration Approach](adr/003-agent-orchestration.md)
